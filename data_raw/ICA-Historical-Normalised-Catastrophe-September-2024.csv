Damage to residential properties was focussed in the NSW town of Tathra. The industry was quick to deploy teams, who engaged directly with victims at an insurance hub established near the government recovery centre. Approximately 90% of claims for this event are closed, 18% faster than in similar historical events.

The pollen count was high due to the combination of hot, dry northerly winds and rye grass to Melbourne's north and west. The moisture from the storm is thought to have caused the pollen to break into smaller particles, more able to penetrate a person's lower airways and cause an asthmatic reaction.

 The storm in June 2007 resulted in major flooding and widespread damage. Seven rivers burst their banks causing millions of dollars of damage to homes, businesses and farms, as well as a significant loss of public and private assets. The rapidly rising floodwaters forced dozens of rescues and evacuations. One person died as a result of the flood waters. During 48 hours of torrential rain more than 1000 emergency service staff worked to save homes and shops in towns throughout Gippsland. Relief centres were set up at Bairnsdale, Lakes Entrance, Paynesville, Sale, Lucknow and Loch Sport and housed up to 360 evacuees. Volunteers also provided medical aid and catering with other organisations such as the Lions Club.
 The State Government established a Flood Recovery Ministerial Taskforce, which assessed community need and planned the recovery program.

The strongest winds from the mainland were from Low Isle at 18/1311 UTC when gusts reached 50 knots (93 km/h). Cape Moreton at 21 March 2004 2230 UTC received gusts to 54 knots (100 km/h). Widespread flooding and damage to roads and property along the far north Queensland coast, mainly between Cooktown and Cairns. Winds and waves brought tide levels above the highest tides of the year and this was particularly evident at Cooktown. Floodwaters closed all major roads into Cairns. A large section of one lane of the Captain Cook Highway north of Cairns collapsed after a landslide consisting of nearly 20 metres of rock and boulders the size of cars destroyed the ocean-side road. The scenic coastal highway and link between Cairns and Port Douglas was closed for several days. Residents were evacuated from the Whitfield range area due to landslides. There were no casualties associated with Tropical Cyclone Grace. In New Caledonia, further strong winds, heavy rains and flooding were experienced. A massive oil slick threatened a popular tourist beach in New Caledonia. Officials in the French Pacific territory put up barriers around the island of Amedee, which was threatened by a toxic oil slick, estimated to cover an area of 20 square kilometres.

On 21 March, Cyclone Fay intensified even further as the storm approached Scott Reef where significant damage occurred. Looping back towards the Kimberley coast, Fay - now a Category 3 system - approached to within 90 km of Broome on 25 March, before turning to the south-west. Broome experienced strong winds with gale-force gusts, some heavy rain and heavy seas but escaped serious damage. Fay then headed further away from the coast on the 25th before resuming a general southerly track on the 26th. Fay crossed the Pilbara coast between the pastoral stations of Pardoo and Wallal between 8 am and 9 am WST on 27 March as a Category 4 storm with estimated maximum wind gusts of around 235 km/h near the center. The cyclone weakened as it moved inland. Little wind damage was reported from the storm despite its intensity as it made landfall in a remote part of the WA coast and consequently only impacted sparsely populated pastoral and mining areas. As the system passed close to the Yarrie mine its translation speed reduced and some 200 workers were locked down for 8 hours in two squash courts as accommodation units were overturned, water tanks ""shredded"" and power lines cut.

Late in November, an active pulse in the MJO developed over equatorial waters in the southern Indian Ocean. Convergence into the area was further assisted by a low-level cross-equatorial surge from the northern hemisphere. By 0000 UTC 2 December, a low pressure system had developed near 5S 95E tracking south-southwest. Intensification of the low was rapid and at 0000 UTC 3 December, tropical cyclone Graham was named whilst located about 750 km northwest of Cocos Island. Within 24 hours, satellite imagery was indicating the development of an eye. Shortly thereafter, Graham commenced a gradual recurvature towards the southeast under the influence of a deep-layer anticyclone to the east. Maximum intensity was reached at 1500 UTC 5 December with mean winds estimated to be 65 m/s. Tropical cyclone Graham made its closest approach to Cocos Island at 2300 UTC 5 December whilst located 150 km to the north-northeast. Although gales were reported on the island for a short period, damaging winds did not occur. The lowest MSLP recorded was 1004 hPa, indicative of the compact nature of the circulation. As the cyclone tracked away from Cocos Island, it encountered strengthening upper-level westerly winds ahead of an advancing trough and began to shear. By 0000 UTC 8 December, the low-level circu- lation centre was fully exposed on the northwest side of the deep convection.

 Electricity supply problems were reported as well as other property damage. As the rain eased in Sydney the wind shifted in a southerly direction early on 6 August. This caused the Blue Mountains to experience heavy rains, resulting in the largest floods on record on the Cox and Grose rivers. The rain moved south to the Illawarra and west of Wollongong, adding to the already high Georges River (recorded at 4.5 m), while; the Hawkesbury River peaked at 12.8 m.

CAT852,Brisbane Hail Storm,1/18/1985,1/18/1985,FY85,QLD,,"The afternoon of Friday the 18th of January, 1985 is remembered by many Brisbane residents as the worst storm they had ever experienced. At the time, it was the second most damaging natural disaster (to the 1974 floods) in the history of Queensland.  In terms of destructive thunderstorms in SE Qld this storm came first, and daylight second. It was a typical Brisbane Summer day, with hot and sultry NW/NE winds. Brisbane residents were bearing up to the heat in anticipation of a cooling thunderstorm ahead of a fresh SE wind change. And that's exactly what happened, but nobody thought the storm would be so severe. A coastal front had slowed and was in the Coolangatta area, and a trough was located over the inland, but ominously, a cold pool of air lay in the upper levels to the SW of Brisbane. During the early afternoon, storms developed as they frequently do in Summer on the Border Ranges, to the South and SSW of Brisbane.  From 2:30pm one particular storm became organised, and by 3:20pm a severe thunderstorm was reported at Mt Alford, SSW of Boonah.  That was the start of Brisbane's most damaging ever thunderstorm. By 4pm, the thunderstorm had assumed massive proportions with cloudtops at 18km and there was a large area of maximum reflectivity - indicative of hail. It was located just east of Harrisville south of Ipswich at this time, and destructive winds and large hail were being reported.  At 4:20pm, with the Goodna area in the far SW Brisbane suburbs being affected, cloudtops suddenly fell to around 16km, but nevertheless, the storm was as severe as ever.  The storm started intensifying again, so that at 4:50pm the cloudtops were nearing 17km as it approached Brisbane's CBD from the SSW. With workers starting to drive home with a weekend in front of them, it hit. Suburbs including Oxley, Kenmore, Toowong, Chermside, Hendra, Nundah and Sandgate were hit particularly hard.  At the Regional Office of the Brisbane Bureau of Meteorology in the CBD a record wind gust of 145km/h (78kn) was recorded, and then one of the most extreme officially recorded wind gusts in the history of Australian storms struck: 185km/h (100kn) at the Brisbane Airport.  That's close to a 193km/h recorded gust at Tennant Creek in the 1960's.  The winds blew hailstones of up to 7cm in diameter almost horizontal resulting in infinite smashed windows.  Many residents resorted to hiding under tables and mattresses as the giant hailstones smashed through the windows and ferocious winds blew off roofs. At Toombul, damage was severe.  A man whose apartment block had been completely unroofed said: ""The sound was amazing. There were bits of corrugated iron and guttering flying though the air and crashing up against the two buildings"". At the Brisbane Airport, where the extreme wind gust was recorded, 12 pre-fabricated site office sheds were blown and rolled at least a distance of 100m then damaged severely. It was estimated that 20% of the vehicles in the city were hail damaged, over 20 000 buildings damaged and 80 000 premises were blacked out.  The Wool Store furniture centre in Newfarm had 2500 broken windows on the windward side of the building, their damage bill being $5 million.  Amazingly, the store had survived every storm undamaged since 1927. The rainfall intensities that came with the storm were particularly high. Between 60 and 70mm were reported from SW suburbs, the inner City and some N and NE suburbs.  At the Eagle Farm Airport, a 15 min intensity of 57mm was recorded - that's a rate of 228mm/hour. At Clayfield, a family were caught in their home when the local creek rapidly rose.

Very strong winds and hail ruined solid brick houses, holiday shacks and caravans. Cars were pushed sideways along the road and pine trees up to 30 m tall were uprooted. There was no loss of life during the event which was considered amazing. Eleven people were injured requiring hospital admission and 60 others required hospital treatment. While Port Broughton incurred the most damage, other areas were also affected. Destruction was felt from the mid north to northern Adelaide Plains. Clare experienced severe damage. Houses lost their roofs and sheds were demolished in the high winds. Likewise the northern suburbs of Adelaide saw houses unroofed and trees blown over in areas such Salisbury North, Parafield Gardens, and Munno Para. Agriculture was severely impacted with crops damaged, glass houses broken, grape vines stripped, storage tanks squashed, orchards destroyed and many farmers' livelihoods, built up over many years, were lost within ten minutes. According to the Bureau of Meteorology Regional Forecasting Centre, the thunderstorm triggered by the trough line that extended across Yorke Peninsula moved over Port Broughton and produced destructive winds. The winds at all levels through the atmosphere were very strong. A thunderstorm is classified as severe if it produces wind gusts of 90 km per hour of more. On this day gusts were much higher with reports of 135 km per hour to 160 km per hour.

By the morning of 13 April 1979 the low had developed to tropical cyclone intensity and began to move east-southeast.

Undeclared,Cyclone ROSA,2/16/1979,3/1/1979,FY79,QLD NT WA,,"A persisting cloud cluster was initially detected on satellite photographs near the Solomon Islands on 12 February 1979. The system moved westward and became a tropical depression near Samarai on 14 February 1979. The low moved to the Gulf of Carpentaria where the track became very erratic. The system intensified over the Gulf and attained cyclone strength by 0000 UTC 25 February 1979. The track of the system after 0000 UTC 25 February 1979 is depicted below. The cyclone crossed the coast 30 km north-northwest of Bing Bong homestead at 0400 UTC 26 February 1979 with an estimated central pressure of 955 hPa, the lowest pressure during its life cycle. The lowest recorded pressure was 993.3 hPa at Centre Island (in the Sir Edward Pellew Group) at 0000 UTC 26 February 1979. The NOAA research aircraft investigated the cyclone on a single mission as the cyclone was making landfall. At the point of closest approach at 0440 UTC 26 February 1979 the maximum wind encountered was 169 km/h at an altitude of 540 m, 37 km northeast of the centre of the eye. The eye diameter was 37 km. The highest 24-hour rainfall totals were 79 mm at McArthur River on 27 February and 74.2 mm at Centre Island on 26 February. An unofficial report from Nathan River estimated 250 mm on 26 February. The highest cumulative total for the period 20 to 28 February 1979 was 197.8 mm at Centre Island. Coastal and riverside stations in the southwest Gulf of Carpentaria reported unusually high tides. Seas were very rough at Bing Bong where the water level was estimated to have risen two metres above the spring high tide mark. A tide gauge on Groote Eylandt was washed away. Thousands of dollars worth of structural damage to station properties, together with the felling of extensive tracts of forest, were reported in the southwest Gulf of Carpentaria and Roper-McArthur district.

Undeclared,Cyclone KERRY,2/12/1979,3/6/1979,FY79,QLD,,"Kerry was a remarkable tropical cyclone having a long life-span and erratic track. It is also notorious for being only one of two cyclones in the Australian region to have an airplane (a US NOAA research aircraft) fly into the cyclone (the other being TC Rosa ). Indeed a wind speed of 252 km/h measured by this aircraft at an altitude of 540 m was at that time one of the strongest low-level winds measured in a cyclone in the Australian area. Kerry 's origin is linked to a low that became evident near 5S, 170E on 7 February 1979. By 10 February 1979 some cyclonic curvature could be detected in the surrounding convective cloud field. Three days later the system was displaying consistent organisation. The subsequent erratic track is shown below. Kerry intensified steadily while moving west-southwest at 15 to 35 km/h and by 15 February 1979 was classified as a severe tropical cyclone. As Kerry crossed the Solomon Islands maximum observed winds were 72 km/h at about 70 km south of the cyclone, however widespread destruction and loss of life were experienced near the centre, indicating the existence of much stronger winds. Estimated winds from satellite data were 125 to 145 km/h. After moving away from the Solomon Islands on a southwesterly track, Kerry again intensified steadily. Maximum intensity was attained on 19 February 1979 and Kerry then slowly weakened while moving towards landfall on 1 March 1979. Kerry moved erratically around a large loop from 19 to 26 February 1979 crossing its own track at least three times. A factor in the decay after 19 February was the intrusion of dry sub-tropical air that moved around the west and northwest of the cyclone. This is a common feature of decaying cyclones in the Australian region. Aircraft reconnaissance flights on 21 and 22 February 1979 and satellite imagery together show evidence of this dry air and suppressed convection in these quadrants. As Kerry approached the coast across the Whitsunday Islands radar surveillance showed a weak vortex with a ragged and poorly defined eye, but winds of over 108 km/h were observed. Kerry moved west-northwest over land for just over a day then moved northward back over the Coral Sea. The cyclone began to re-intensify east of Townsville late on 2 March 1979. This re-intensification continued while the cyclone moved northward to be east of Cairns on 3 March. Later that day Kerry came under the influence of strong northwesterly winds ahead of an appraoching large amplitude upper-level trough and accelerated to the southeast, weakened and decayed over the ocean on 6 March 1979. Although Kerry was a severe cyclone while well offshore, it had weakened considerably by the time it made landfall and only minor wind damage occurred in some coastal centres and offshore resorts.Nevertheless, boats collectively worth hundreds of thousands of dollars were damaged or destroyed in Mackay harbour on 1 March 1979. Twenty-four hour rainfall totals of up to 250 mm were reported from mainland centres with an isolated fall of 402 mm from Hayman Island in the Whitsunday Group .

Undeclared,Cyclone GRETA,1/7/1979,1/13/1979,FY79,QLD,,"After cyclone Peter lost intensity over eastern Cape York Peninsula in the first few days of January, the trough system in which it was embedded remained over the southern Gulf of Carpentaria-Cape York area. During the next few days the weak, complex low, which remained after Peter , migrated slowly westwards across the southeast and southern Gulf. By late on 7 January 1979 satellite photographs indicated a weak circulation. The system exhibited an erratic course to the northeast of Groote Eylandt and did not intensify until it began to move in an east-northeasterly direction after 2000 UTC 8 January 1979. The path of the low continued in an east-northeasterly direction, with gradual deepending to cyclone intensity and acceleration as it crossed the Gulf. Ship reports at 2100 UTC 9 January 1979 indicated 68 km/h winds 270 km north-northwest of the centre and near 68 km/h winds 100 km to the east-northeast. Greta , moving eastwards at 25 km/h, crossed the coast between 0200 UTC,and 0300 UTC 10 January 1979 about 20 km south of Weipa. Weipa recorded a maximum gust of 78 km/h and a 30-minute calm as the cyclone passed, as well as a minimum pressure of 986 hPa. Little damage was experienced. Greta maintained a well-marked cyclonic circulation during its continued eastward overland movement, but then crossed the Cape York Peninsula east coast, changed course to the south-southeast and then moved parallel to the coast at 15 km/h. The coast was re-crossed at 0500 UTC 11 January in Princess Charlotte Bay with an estimated central pressure of 990 hPa. Banding features remained evident on satellite pictures as it moved inland in a west-southwest direction. It eventually passed close to Alice Springs at 0200 UTC 16 January 1979 with a central pressure near 996 hPa. Greta produced flood rains over northern Cape York Peninsula with heavy rain extending south of Cairns. Flooding was not as serious as with the earlier Peter .

Satellite imagery during 6 January 1979 showed a clearly discernible circular eye and the cyclone was at its most intense. Gordon moved south-southwest towards New Caledonia until 7 January When it gradually turned to a more westerly track. Throughout 7 and 8 January 1979 satellite photographs indicated a marked weakening of the system. Reports from ships in the area and offshore automatic weather stations indicated winds generally from 55 to 70 km/h with one report of 83 km/h from Frederick Reef early on 10 January 1979. Throughout 10 January Gordon continued to weaken and lost all tropical cyclone characteristics: it continued to move westward, however, as a tropical low. On the following morning, the low changed to a west-southwesterly track and winds to 83 km/h were reported from offshore and coastal areas as the system approached the coast. It crossed the coast just south of Proserpine early on 12 January 1979 and rapidly decayed. Twenty-four hourly rainfall totals of up to 50 mm occurred in some coastal areas as the low crossed the coast but no significant structural damage or flooding was directly attributable to Gordon. Strong winds and rough seas that developed along the central and parts of the south coast of Queensland, however, caused some beach erosion in those areas.",FNQ,Cyclone,1979,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
